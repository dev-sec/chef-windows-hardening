# windows-hardening (Chef Cookbook)

This cookbook provides recipes for ensuring that a Windows 2012 R2 system is compliant with the [DevSec Windows Baseline](https://github.com/dev-sec/windows-baseline).

### Platforms

- Windows Server 2012
- Windows Server 2012 R2
- Windows Server 2016
- Windows Server 2016 Nano Server

### Roadmap

This cookbook aims to be the go-to-resource to implement hardening for Windows environments. In order to achieve that plan to cover the requirements of

- CIS Windows 2012R2
- CIS Windows 2016
- STIG Windows 2012R2

Any contributions to achieve that are welcome!

## Coding guidelines

Use Chef resources wherever possible. Some Chef resources we use to manage Windows:

- [registry_key](https://docs.chef.io/windows.html#registry-key)
- [powershell_script](https://docs.chef.io/windows.html#powershell-script)
- [security_policy](https://github.com/grdnrio/windows-security-policy)

If no Chef resource is available, we prefer to use Powershell or Powershell DSC.

## Testing the cookbook

### Test-Kitchen

This cookbooks ships with a test-kitchen setup to verify that the implementation follows the [DevSec Windows Baseline](https://github.com/dev-sec/windows-baseline):

```
kitchen test
```

### Chef Server and Chef Compliance

If you use Chef Server, you can bootstrap a node and run a Chef Compliance against them it. It is recommended to use an EC2 instance in a Chef environment, made up of a Chef Server and a Compliance Server. The following command can be used for bootstrapping a node.

```
knife ec2 server create --node-name windows-test --flavor t2.medium --image ami-29eb7e5a --security-group-ids sg-238e5744 --user-data win-userdata.ps1 --winrm-user Administrator --winrm-password Ch4ng3m3 --ssh-key emea-sa-shared -r 'recipe[base-win2012-hardening::enable_winrm_access]'
```

**Please note the following:**
* To bootstrap a Windows node using Knife you need a predictable password. The `win-userdata.ps1` file, in this repo, provides this.
* You need a security group that allows winrm access and RDP access.
* We set a run-list. The `enable_winrm_access` recipe prepares the node for a manual Compliance scan.

## Applying at scale
This cookbook is currently in development. It does not cover all requirements to provide a fully hardened Windows environment yet. Any contributions are welcome to improve the cookbook. If you wish to apply this at scale, use a role and add the cookbook to its runlist, there is no need to apply a specific recipe.
